'''Given an array arr of integers, check if there exist two indices i and j such that :

i != j
0 <= i, j < arr.length
arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]
 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [10,2,5,3]
Output: true
Explanation: For i = 0 and j = 2, arr[i] == 10 == 2 * 5 == 2 * arr[j]
Example 2:

Input: arr = [3,1,7,11]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no i and j that satisfy the conditions.'''
