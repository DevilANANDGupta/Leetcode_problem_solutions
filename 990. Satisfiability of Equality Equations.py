'''You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "xi==yi" or "xi!=yi".Here, xi and yi are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
Example 2:

Input: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations'''

        uf = {}

        def find(x):
            uf.setdefault(x, x)
            if x != uf[x]:
                uf[x] = find(uf[x])
            return uf[x]

        def union(x, y):
            uf[find(x)] = find(y)
            
        for e in equations:
            if e[1] == '=':
                union(e[0], e[-1])
        for e in equations:
            if e[1] == '!':
                if find(e[0]) == find(e[-1]):
                    return False
        return True
